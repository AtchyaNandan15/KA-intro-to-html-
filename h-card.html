        <h3> <em>Poem In honor of Plant a tree day</em> </h3>
          <p>Green and blue like our earth.
    <br>Soon the earth is becoming yellow and brown for the damage.<br>  we are using the earth and taking the purpose out. <br>The earth is not crying blue tears, it is crying garbage and oil and dirt.<br> We overtake the ocean like a disease.<br> The earth will no longer take this damage. <br>It will soon die of anger.<br> The anger is building more and more heat into our atmosphere.<br> One day everyone will realize what they have done. <br>They will realize what the real purpose of the earth was.<br> The real purpose it is to take care of it because it is providing us with a home, food and water.<br> They will realize giving it destruction and pollution was wrong.<br>  Once they realize the importance they will be too late. <br>The earth is dying.<br> So they slowly realize if the earth dies so will they.<br> <em> Atchya Nandan </em> </p>
